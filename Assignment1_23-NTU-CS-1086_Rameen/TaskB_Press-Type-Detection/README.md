## Description
This project demonstrates how to detect **short press** and **long press** actions using a **single button** on the **ESP32**.  
Each press type triggers a different response with visual feedback on an **OLED display** and hardware components.  

### Functional Overview:
- **Short Press (<1.5 seconds):**  
  - Toggles all 3 LEDs **ON/OFF** simultaneously.  
  - Displays `"Short-Press Detected"` on the OLED.  
- **Long Press (>1.5 seconds):**  
  - Activates a **buzzer tone (1 kHz for 0.5 sec)**.  
  - Displays `"Long-Press Detected"` and `"Playing Buzzer..."` on the OLED.  
- **OLED Header:**  
  - Shows the title `"PRESS-TYPE DETECT"` with an underline header.

## üìù Notes
- The project uses **Adafruit_SSD1306** and **Adafruit_GFX** libraries for OLED control.  
- **tone()** function generates PWM-based sound signals on the buzzer.  
- The button is configured with **internal pull-up**, so it reads **LOW** when pressed.  
- Debouncing handled through simple logic using `millis()` timing.
